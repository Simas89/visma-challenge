This is a NextJS/Typescript/Redux project.

There was no directions on how to approach this challenge, so i chose to make it as this were a large project.
You'll find folder structure, and dependencies setup in a way that is ready to scale.

It is deployed to Vercel using GitHub actions CI/CD pipeline where it first need to pass Cypress integration tests.

**SETUP**
Preferred package manager is yarn, but you can use npm

**install**

    yarn install

**run locally**

    yarn dev

**run tests locally**

    yarn dev

and in the other terminal

    yarn cy:open

For the sake of simplicity i have included `.env` file in the repository if you woould like to have out of box working version locally too.
